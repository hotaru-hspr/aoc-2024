## Day 1

### Part 1

Firstly, the file is read and the data is converted to integers and split into two lists. Then, we sort them in ascending order, iterate through index and create a sum of the absolute differences of the values in the corresponding index.

### Part 2

Similar to Part 1, but after iterating through index, you create a sum of similary scores of the values in the corresponding index (the value in list 1 times the number of recurrences of the value in list 2).
